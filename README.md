The repository UrbanFiresData contains RMarkdown files written to support the data descriptor 
Bispo et al. (2023) A decade of urban fires: Portuguese events between 2012 and 2022. 
The main goal is to present the source code (.Rmd files) behind the study. 

It contains two .Rmd files: 
(1) \texttt{Raw2Final.Rmd}, which includes the code from reading raw data till writing the final dataset, passing through data transforming, data cleaning and structural 
validation actions, and 
(2) \texttt{CValidation.Rmd}, containing the code related to content validation procedures, which follow the actions taken on the former Rmd file.


The work was funded by Portuguese national funds through the FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., 
under the scope of the project DSAIPA/DS/0088/2019 and research and development units UNIDEMI (project UIDB/00667/2020) and 
NOVAMATH (projects UIDB/00297/2020 and UIDP/00297/2020).
